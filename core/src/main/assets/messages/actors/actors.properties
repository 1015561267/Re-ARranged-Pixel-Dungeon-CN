actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_dust=I'm looking for some _corpse dust._ It's a special kind of cursed bone meal that usually shows up in places like this.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_ember=I'm looking for some _fresh embers_ from a newborn fire elemental.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_berry=The old warden of this prison kept a _rotberry plant,_ and I'm after one of its seeds. The plant has probably gone wild by now though, so getting it to give up a seed might be tricky. Its garden should be somewhere around here.

actors.mobs.demonspawner.desc=This twisting amalgam of dwarven flesh is responsible for creating ripper demons from the dwarves that have died in this region. Clearly the demons see no issue with using every resource they can against their enemies.\n\nWhile visually terrifying, demon spawners have no means of moving or directly defending themselves. Their considerable mass makes them hard to kill quickly however, and they will spawn ripper demons more quickly when they are under threat.\n\n_Demon spawners seem to be connected to some central source of demonic power. Killing them may weaken it._

actors.mobs.dm100.name=DM-100
actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison.

They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!
actors.mobs.dm201.desc=The dwarves briefly experimented with more heavily emphasizing the DM-200's lack of mobility and created some DM models that are entirely stationary. The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.dm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.
