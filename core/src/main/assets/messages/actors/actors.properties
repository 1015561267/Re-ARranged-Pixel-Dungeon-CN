actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_duelist=Hey Human! You look like a brave one.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_cleric=Hey Human! You look like an important one.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_start=Wanna be useful, eh? Yeah I got something you could do. I built dis workshop ontop of an old mine, it's just down dat ladder. Take dis pickaxe and mine me some _dark gold ore. 40 pieces_ should be enough. The rock down der is nice and soft so _you'll be able to mine through the walls with some effort._\n\nWhat do you mean, how am I gonna pay? You greedy...\n\nOk, ok, I can do some smithin' for you. Consider yourself lucky, I'm the only blacksmith around.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_crystal=Careful though, the mine's dangerous for a little human like you. It's been abandoned for a while, and bunch of crystals have started growing. They're shiny, but too fragile to be worth anythin', and they've got some magic things protecting 'em. They're pretty strong, so _be careful where you mine_ or you'll get their attention.\n\nThere's a _giant crystal_ somewhere too. It's a lot tougher, so be prepared for a fight if you start breakin' it. I'll bet smashing it will slow all the crystal growth down though, so I'll pay extra if you can do it.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_gnoll=Careful though, the mine's dangerous for a little human like you. Some gnolls want the gold too and now they're wreckin' the place. They're stupid things, so their mining has caused all sorts of collapses and cave-ins. You'll have to mine though it, so _look for recently disturbed rock._\n\nI think one of the gnolls is causing most of the trouble, probably a _geomancer shaman_ or somethin'. I'll pay extra, if you can find and kill it, but I'm sure it'll fight back.
actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.intro_quest_fungi=Careful though, the mine's dangerous for a little human like you. There's some sorta fungus monster that's been growing down there. It's got mushroom sentries that're really deadly if they see you, but they can't get up and chase you at least. _Keep out of sight_ if you want to stay alive.\n\nI'll pay extra if you can manage to take down the _biggest mushrom,_ but it'll take some real effort. It's connected to a bunch of mycelium nodes that're hidden in the walls. You'll have to break most of 'em before you can really damage it.

actors.mobs.npcs.blacksmith.exit_warn_full=You done? You've got lots of gold, but make sure you haven't left any of your gear behind.\n\n_Remember, I'm not lettin' you back in once you come up._

actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_warrior=That's an interesting seal you've got there, they're usually in one piece. You a disgraced hero or something? Well whatever you've done is none of my business, your coins are still good.
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_mage=Hehe, I think I've seen a wanted poster with your name on it somewhere in the city. On the run are we? Oh you're innocent are you? Of course, of course... Don't fret, I've got better things to do than report on you, but perhaps you should buy something to be sure?
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_rogue=Have you come from the thieves guild to clear the area? No, just shopping? Well kill a few monsters while you're here anyway. Don't expect a discount either, I pay good protection money to you people and you're barely keeping me safe down here.
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_huntress=You seem to be out of your element miss. Tight dungeon corridors aren't as spacious as grand halls or the forests surrounding the city are they? Hehe, oh don't mind my rambling, why not buy something?
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_prison_duelist=Well if it isn't the travelling hero! If you're trying to save another town then good luck, the dangers here are much worse than petty bandit gangs. I'm sure you'll do better than anyone else could, just try to not die right outside my store.
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_caves=Spend money, live longer.\n\nOh and say hello to that Troll blacksmith for me if you see him. Remind the lug that he still owes me money for that hammer I sold him last week!
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_city=My wares can keep you safe down here.\n\n...And don't loiter if you please. It took forever to get the locals down here to leave me alone, I don't want you attracting any trouble!
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_halls=Hey there, I've got special prices for demon hunters!\n\nOh and be careful down there! The demons below won't care how courageous you are. You can't come back up and spend more money if you're dead! ;)\n\nAre the demons like me? Hehe, not at all. I'm just a small fellow, not much of a fighter, and I've managed to keep my mind intact. The demons below are much stronger things, and they've all been enslaved by... well... just be careful down there.
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.talk_ascent=I don't know what you're planning to do with that amulet but I want no part of it. Buy something and move on, we both need to leave this place!
actors.mobs.npcs.shopkeeper.desc=This stout guy looks more appropriate for a trade district in some large city than for a dungeon. His prices explain why he prefers to do business here.

actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.name=old wandmaker
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_warrior=Oh, hello there! What a pleasant surprise to meet a warrior from the north in such a depressing place! You must have travelled quite far to get here. If you're looking for adventure, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_rogue=Oh Goodness, you startled me! I haven't met a bandit from this place that still has his sanity, so you must be from the surface! If you're up to helping a stranger out, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_mage=Oh, hello %s! I heard there was some ruckus regarding you and the wizards institute? Oh never mind, I never liked those stick-in-the-muds anyway. If you're willing, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_huntress=Oh, hello miss! A friendly face is a pleasant surprise down here isn't it? In fact, I swear I've seen your face before, but I can't put my finger on it... Oh never mind, if you're here for adventure, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_duelist=Oh, hello miss! What a pleasant surprise to meet a hero in such a depressing place! If you're up to helping an old man out, I may have a task for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_1=\n\nI came here to find a rare ingredient for a wand, but I've gotten myself lost, and my magical shield is weakening. I'll need to leave soon, but can't bear to go without getting what I came for.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_dust=I'm looking for some _corpse dust._ It's a special kind of cursed bone meal that usually shows up in places like this. There should be a barricaded room around here somewhere, I'm sure some dust will turn up there. Do be careful though, the curse the dust carries is quite potent, _get back to me as fast as you can_ and I'll cleanse it for you.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_ember=I'm looking for some _fresh embers_ from a newborn fire elemental. Elementals usually pop up when a summoning ritual isn't controlled, so just find some candles and a ritual site and I'm sure you can get one to pop up. You'll want to _avoid boxing yourself in_ while fighting it though, or you could _keep some sort of freezing item handy._ Newborn Elementals are pretty powerful and chaotic, but they can't stand the cold.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_berry=The old warden of this prison kept a _rotberry plant,_ and I'm after one of its seeds. The plant has probably gone wild by now though, so getting it to give up a seed might be tricky. Its garden should be somewhere around here. Try to _keep away from its vine lashers_ if you want to stay in one piece. Using fire might be tempting but please don't, you'll kill the plant and destroy its seeds.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.intro_2=\n\nIf you can get that for me, I'll be happy to pay you with one of my finely crafted wands! I brought two with me, so you can take whichever one you prefer.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.reminder_dust=Any luck with corpse dust, %s? Look for some barricades.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.reminder_ember=Any luck with those embers, %s? You'll need to find four candles and the ritual site.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.reminder_berry=Any luck with a Rotberry seed, %s? Look for a room filled with vegetation.
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.npcs.wandmaker.desc=This old yet hale gentleman wears a slightly confused expression. He is protected by a magic shield.



###mobs
actors.mobs.acidic.name=acidic scorpio
actors.mobs.acidic.desc=These huge arachnid-like demonic creatures avoid close combat, preferring to fire crippling serrated spikes from long distances. This one appears to be dripping with corrosive ooze.

actors.mobs.albino.name=albino rat
actors.mobs.albino.desc=This is a rare breed of marsupial rat, with pure white fur and jagged teeth.

actors.mobs.armoredstatue.name=armored statue
actors.mobs.armoredstatue.desc=You would think that it's just another one of this dungeon's inanimate statues, but its red glowing eyes give it away.\n\nIt seems to be in great condition because of the armor it's wearing, it might be very hard to kill.\n\nWhile the statue itself is made of stone, the _%1$s_ and _%2$s_ it's wielding look real.

actors.mobs.bandit.name=crazy bandit

actors.mobs.bat.name=vampire bat
actors.mobs.bat.desc=These brisk and tenacious inhabitants of the caves are much more dangerous than they seem. They replenish their health with each successful attack, which allows them to defeat much larger opponents.

actors.mobs.bee.name=golden bee
actors.mobs.bee.desc_honey=Despite their small size, golden bees tend to protect their home fiercely. This one has been placated, and seems to want to follow you.
actors.mobs.bee.desc=Despite their small size, golden bees tend to protect their home fiercely. This one is very mad, better keep your distance.

actors.mobs.brute.name=gnoll brute
actors.mobs.brute.enraged=enraged
actors.mobs.brute.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.brute.desc=Brutes are the largest, strongest, and toughest of all gnolls. When mortally wounded, they go berserk, gaining temporary shielding and a large boost to damage.
actors.mobs.brute$bruterage.name=brute rage
actors.mobs.brute$bruterage.desc=This gnoll brute is dying, but wants to take you with it!\n\nThe brute will die when its shielding wears off, either due to time or if it is damaged. In the meantime, it will deal hugely increased damage, so watch out!\n\nShield remaining: %d.

actors.mobs.causticslime.name=caustic slime
actors.mobs.causticslime.desc=This slime seems to have been tainted by the dark magic emanating from below. It has lost its usual green color, and drips with caustic ooze.

actors.mobs.crab.name=sewer crab
actors.mobs.crab.desc=These huge crabs are at the top of the food chain in the sewers. They are extremely fast and their thick carapace can withstand heavy blows.

actors.mobs.crystalguardian.name=crystal guardian
actors.mobs.crystalguardian.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.crystalguardian.desc=These large crystalline guardians almost look like statues, if it weren't for their bright glowing eyes. The hardened crystal they're made out of causes them to be sluggish but very tough, so _it's best to leave them to sleep in their crystal nest for as long as possible._\n\nDue to their size, crystal guardians will move much more slowly in enclosed spaces. They're also so durable that they're impossible to kill outright. They can be beaten down and temporarily disabled, but they'll just get back up again after a little while.

actors.mobs.crystalmimic.name=crystal mimic
actors.mobs.crystalmimic.ate=The mimic ate your %s!
actors.mobs.crystalmimic.escaped=The crystal mimic has escaped!
actors.mobs.crystalmimic.desc=Mimics are magical creatures which can take any shape they wish. In dungeons they almost always choose a shape of a treasure chest, in order to lure in unsuspecting adventurers.\n\nCrystal mimics are trickier than their regular cousins, and prefer to avoid conflict while stealing loot. They will attempt to sprint away once discovered, and have the ability to reposition enemies when they attack.

actors.mobs.crystalspire.name=crystal spire
actors.mobs.crystalspire.warning=The crystal vibrates as you strike it. Keeping this up is bound to draw attention to you...
actors.mobs.crystalspire.alert=The vibration grows and rumbles through the whole cave!
actors.mobs.crystalspire.desc=This gigantic spire of ultra hard crystal is probably the source of all the strange crystalline creatures in this cave. Your regular weapons are ineffective against it, so you'll need to use your pickaxe if you want to destroy it.\n\n_Make sure you're prepared before you start breaking it._ Such a big crystal is likely to take a while to mine through, and you probably won't be able to do it undisturbed. The spire itself may even have some means of defending itself as well. _Perhaps the spire's own attacks could be used against its minions._

actors.mobs.crystalwisp.name=crystal wisp
actors.mobs.crystalwisp.beam_kill=The beam of light killed you...
actors.mobs.crystalwisp.desc=A small angry floating chunk of hardened crystal that's producing a bright glow. While not especially strong, crystal wisps will shoot a damaging beam of light at you if they have a clear shot.\n\nWisps are small enough to easily move through the various crystal outcroppings, but they aren't able to shoot through them.

actors.mobs.demonspawner.name=demon spawner
actors.mobs.demonspawner.on_death=The demonic energy here seems to lessen as the spawner dies.
actors.mobs.demonspawner.desc=This twisting amalgam of dwarven flesh is responsible for creating ripper demons from the dwarves that have died in this region. Clearly the demons see no issue with using every resource they can against their enemies.\n\nWhile visually terrifying, demon spawners have no means of moving or directly defending themselves. Their considerable mass makes them hard to kill quickly however, and they will spawn ripper demons more quickly when they are under threat.\n\n_Demon spawners seem to be connected to some central source of demonic power. Killing them may weaken it._

actors.mobs.dm100.name=DM-100
actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison. Their electrical shocks proved too weak however, and so they were gifted to the human city above. They went unused for years and eventually found their way to the prison, where the warden initially deemed them too cruel to use. However, as the prisoners became more unruly they became a necessity.

actors.mobs.dm200.name=DM-200
actors.mobs.dm200.vent=The DM-200 fires a jet of toxic exhaust!
actors.mobs.dm200.desc=The DM-200 is the second generation of dwarven 'defense machine', which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves and city below. They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

actors.mobs.dm201.name=DM-201
actors.mobs.dm201.vent=The DM-201 lobs a corrosive grenade!
actors.mobs.dm201.desc=The dwarves briefly experimented with more heavily emphasizing the DM-200's lack of mobility and created some DM models that are entirely stationary. The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

actors.mobs.dm300.name=DM-300
actors.mobs.dm300.notice=UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL DETECTED!
actors.mobs.dm300.shield=DM-300 pulls power from the exposed wires and shields itself!

actors.mobs.dm300.pylons_destroyed=ALERT! INSTABILITY DETECTED IN POWER GRID!
actors.mobs.dm300.rankings_desc=Crushed by the DM-300
actors.mobs.dm300.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.dm300.defeated=CRITICAL DAMAGE! ATTEMPTING SHUTDO-
actors.mobs.dm300.desc=The DM-300 is the largest and most powerful 'defense machine' that the dwarves ever built. Such an awesome machine is difficult to manufacture, so the dwarves only ever made a few to guard the entrances to their underground metropolis.\n\nIt is equipped with vents to jet its toxic exhaust fumes and a high power drill that it can use both to attack and disrupt the earth. DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
actors.mobs.dm300.desc_supercharged=DM-300 is currently charged full of electrical energy. In this form DM-300 cannot be damaged and moves at double speed! Additionally, its drill now spins fast enough for it to _tunnel through solid rock,_ though it moves much more slowly when doing this.\n\nAttacking DM-300 directly is pointless while it is supercharged, but _something in the area must be providing it with this energy,_ destroying that may weaken it.

actors.mobs.dwarfking.name=King of Dwarves
actors.mobs.dwarfking.notice=How dare you! You have no idea what you're interfering with!
actors.mobs.dwarfking.lifelink_1=I have need of your essence, slave!

actors.mobs.dwarfking.losing=No! You can't do this... you have no idea what lies below...
actors.mobs.dwarfking.defeated=You've... Doomed us all...
actors.mobs.dwarfking.rankings_desc=Fell Before the King of Dwarves
actors.mobs.dwarfking.desc=Many years ago one of the highest wizards in the dwarven court uncovered secrets which gave him tremendous power over life and death. He soon put this power to use, subjugating and corrupting his peers, his king, and eventually every dwarven citizen. Now he is king, ruler over a legion of undead subjects.\n\nThe King of Dwarves is an aggressive foe, who will attempt to surround and overwhelm his enemies with his horde of undead minions.
actors.mobs.dwarfking$dkghoul.rankings_desc=Fell Before the King of Dwarves

actors.mobs.elemental$fireelemental.name=fire elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$fireelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult magic isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nFire elementals are a common type of elemental which deals damage with fiery magic. They will set their target ablaze with melee attacks, and can occasionally shoot bolts of fire as well.
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.name=newborn fire elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.charging=The elemental is charging up!
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult magic isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nThis fire elemental is freshly summoned, but still quite dangerous!
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.desc_boss=Because of the chaotic nature of its summoning, this elemental can only spread fire in inaccurate blasts after charging for a turn.
actors.mobs.elemental$newbornfireelemental.desc_ally=Because this elemental was summoned by a spell, it has a little more control over its flame. It's incapable of making ranged attacks, but will ignite enemies it attacks in melee.
actors.mobs.elemental$frostelemental.name=frost elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$frostelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult magic isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nFrost elementals are a common type of elemental which weakens enemies with chilling magic. They will chill their target with melee and occasional ranged attacks. Their magic is much more effective in water.
actors.mobs.elemental$shockelemental.name=shock elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$shockelemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult magic isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nShock elementals are a less common type of elemental which disrupts its enemies with electricity and flashes of light. In melee they will arc electricity to nearby enemies, and deal bonus damage to their primary target if they are in water. They will also occasionally focus a ranged blast of light at their target, temporarily blinding them.
actors.mobs.elemental$chaoselemental.name=chaos elemental
actors.mobs.elemental$chaoselemental.desc=Elementals are chaotic creatures that are often created when powerful occult magic isn't properly controlled. Elementals have minimal intelligence, and are usually associated with a particular type of magic.\n\nChaos elementals are rare and dangerous elementals which haven't stabilized to a particular element. They will unleash wild unpredictable magic when they attack.

actors.mobs.eye.name=evil eye
actors.mobs.eye.deathgaze_kill=The deathgaze killed you...
actors.mobs.eye.desc=Evil Eyes are floating balls of pent up demonic energy. While they are capable of melee combat, their true strength comes from their magic.\n\nAfter building energy for a short time an Evil Eye will unleash a devastating beam of energy called the _deathgaze._ Anything within the Evil Eye's sights will take tremendous damage, wise adventurers will run for cover.

actors.mobs.fetidrat.name=fetid rat
actors.mobs.fetidrat.desc=Something is clearly wrong with this rat. Its greasy black fur and rotting skin are very different from the healthy rats you've seen previously. Its pale green eyes make it seem especially menacing.\n\nThe rat carries a cloud of horrible stench with it, it's overpoweringly strong up close.\n\nDark ooze dribbles from the rat's mouth, it eats through the floor but seems to dissolve in water.

actors.mobs.fungalcore.name=fungal core
actors.mobs.fungalcore.desc=This gigantic mushroom must be the source of all the fungal activity in this cave.

actors.mobs.fungalsentry.name=fungal sentry
actors.mobs.fungalsentry.desc=This especially tall mushroom acts as a point of defense for the larger fungal network living in this cave.\n\nIt is immobile, but will shoot precise blasts of poison at anything that gets within its line of sight. While the impact of these blasts is fairly weak, _they can stack up deadly amounts of poison very quickly._ While it can be killed, it's probably best to avoid it.

actors.mobs.fungalspinner.name=fungal spinner
actors.mobs.fungalspinner.desc=This cave spinner appears to be being controlled by a parasitic fungus. The fungus has also changed its abilities, replacing its  web and venom sacks with fungal growth.\n\nThe fungal spinner will spit plant life at you instead of webs, spreading fungal vegetation and potentially rooting you. While it can't poison, the fungal spinner will gain substantial damage resistance if it is adjacent to any mushrooms.

actors.mobs.ghoul.name=dwarven ghoul
actors.mobs.ghoul.desc=As dwarven society slowly began to collapse, and the current king of the dwarves seized absolute power, those who were weak or who resisted him were not treated well. As the king grew more adept at wielding dark magic, he bent these dwarves to his will, and now they make up the footsoldiers of his army.\n\nGhouls are not especially strong on their own, but always travel in groups and are much harder to kill in large numbers. _When a ghoul is defeated, it will rise again after a few turns as long as another ghoul is nearby._

actors.mobs.gnoll.name=gnoll scout
actors.mobs.gnoll.desc=Gnolls are hyena-like humanoids. They dwell in sewers and dungeons, venturing up to raid the surface from time to time. Gnoll scouts are regular members of their pack, they are not as strong as brutes and not as intelligent as shamans.

actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.name=gnoll geomancer

actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.rock_kill=The flying boulder killed you...
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.rockfall_kill=The falling rocks killed you...
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc=This impressively tall senior gnoll must be the source of the various earth-moving magic around here, and the organizer of all the gnoll activity. Unlike the gnoll sappers in the area, the geomancer is quite adept with its magic, and cannot be damaged by thrown or falling rocks. It doesn't have any way to fight in melee combat though.
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc_armor=The geomancer is currently encased in a layer of rock armor. _You'll need to get up close and break it away with your pickaxe before you can damage the geomancer._
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc_armor_sapper=_A nearby gnoll sapper is holding a device that is empowering the geomancer's rock armor. You won't be able to damage it at all right now!_
actors.mobs.gnollgeomancer.desc_sleeping=This impressively tall gnoll shaman is surrounded by a layer of rock, and looks almost like a statue. Looking closely you can see the rock magically move in time with the senior gnoll's breathing. It can't be harmed while encased in rock like this, and it appears to be enjoying a literal dirt nap.\n\nYou can probably break through the layers of rock with your pickaxe, but _be sure you're ready for a fight when you do so._ The geomancer must be the source of the various earth-moving magic around here, and the organizer of all the gnoll activity. _Defeating the gnolls scattered around here before fighting it might be a good idea._

actors.mobs.gnollguard.name=gnoll guard
actors.mobs.gnollguard.spear_warn=The gnoll lands a vicious blow with the tip of its spear!
actors.mobs.gnollguard.desc=A large and tough looking gnoll wielding a spear and a shield, but no helmet. These guards are likely brutes in training, roped into helping protect the mine from encroaching wildlife.\n\nThe gnoll guard is strong enough to wield the spear in one hand, but can't use it very well. _It will need fairly open space to attack at a distance, and will do notably less damage to you if you get up close._
actors.mobs.gnollguard.desc_armor=_A nearby gnoll sapper is holding a device that is granting this guard earthen armor, heavily reducing the damage it takes._

actors.mobs.gnollsapper.name=gnoll sapper
actors.mobs.gnollsapper.desc=A small and weak but intelligent gnoll with pale fur and a satchel full of various gadgets. They are likely here to assist with prospecting and mining dark gold, and have a nearby guard for protection. They are capable of fighting, but their attacks are pitifully weak, no stronger than a gnoll scout.\n\nInstead of fighting directly, sappers prefer to use the various gadgets they have to make the rocky environment attack for them. They don't know earth-moving magic themselves though, and so are pretty likely to use their gadgets recklessly. _There should be lots of ways to use their attacks against them, or their guard._

actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.name=gnoll trickster
actors.mobs.gnolltrickster.desc=A strange looking creature, even by gnoll standards. It hunches forward with a wicked grin, almost cradling the satchel hanging over its shoulder. Its eyes are wide with a strange mix of fear and excitement.\n\nThere is a large collection of poorly made darts in its satchel, they all seem to be tipped with various harmful substances.

actors.mobs.goldenmimic.name=golden mimic
actors.mobs.goldenmimic.desc=Mimics are magical creatures which can take any shape they wish. In dungeons they almost always choose a shape of a treasure chest, in order to lure in unsuspecting adventurers.\n\nGolden mimics are tougher mimics which try to attract the strongest adventurers. They have better loot, but are also much stronger than regular mimics.

actors.mobs.golem.name=golem
actors.mobs.golem.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.golem.desc=Golems are an attempt to correct the previous flaws in dwarven machinery via the dwarves newfound use of magic. They are much more compact and efficient compared to the DM-300 while still being very deadly.\n\nWhile golems are still too large to fit into passageways, the dwarves have given them new magical abilities to compensate. Golems can teleport themselves between rooms, and teleport enemies to them when they are out of reach.

actors.mobs.goo.name=Goo
actors.mobs.goo.notice=GLURP-GLURP!

actors.mobs.goo.enraged=enraged
actors.mobs.goo.gluuurp=GLUUUURP!
actors.mobs.goo.rankings_desc=Absorbed by the Goo
actors.mobs.goo.desc=Little is known about The Goo. It's quite possible that it is not even a creature, but rather a conglomerate of vile substances from the sewers that somehow gained basic intelligence. Regardless, dark magic is certainly what has allowed Goo to exist.\n\nIts gelatinous nature has let it absorb lots of dark energy, you feel a chill just from being near. If Goo is able to attack with this energy you won't live for long.

actors.mobs.greatcrab.name=great crab
actors.mobs.greatcrab.noticed=The crab blocks with its massive claw.
actors.mobs.greatcrab.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.greatcrab.desc=This crab is gigantic, even compared to other sewer crabs. Its blue shell is covered in cracks and barnacles, showing great age. It lumbers around slowly, barely keeping balance with its massive claw.\n\nWhile the crab only has one claw, its size easily compensates. The crab holds the claw in front of any threat, shielding itself behind an impenetrable wall of carapace. However, the crab cannot block attacks it doesn't see coming, or attacks from multiple enemies at once.

actors.mobs.guard.name=prison guard
actors.mobs.guard.scorpion=Get over here!
actors.mobs.guard.def_verb=blocked
actors.mobs.guard.desc=Once keepers of the prison, these guards have long since become no different than the inmates. They shamble like zombies, brainlessly roaming through the halls in search of anything out of place, like you!\n\nThey carry chains around their hip, possibly used to pull in enemies to close range.

actors.mobs.mimic.name=mimic
actors.mobs.mimic.reveal=That chest is a mimic!
actors.mobs.mimic.hidden_hint=Something about this chest feels off... Walking up and trying to open it might be a bad idea.
